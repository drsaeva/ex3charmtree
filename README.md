# ex3charmtree

Responsive web app for visualizing Charm cascades in Exalted 3rd Edition. Starting small - at first, this will begin with a single Solar Charm cascade (Archery). Eventually it will include all Solar Charm cascades, Martial Arts Charm cascades, and, as they are released, Charm cascades for other Exalted splats.
